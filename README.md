# Quicksort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) version of quicksort. Use the
template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some
basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

Hint: To make qicksort iterative, think about the part of the array each
recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

## Resources

I heavily used the youtube channel: CS Dojo for understanding of the quicksort algorithm.

I also found a useful article/post regarding the implimentation which I think helped me with the js implimentation.
